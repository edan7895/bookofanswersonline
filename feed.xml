      We often move through life expecting things to unfold a certain way — people to act how we wish, outcomes to meet our plans, moments to feel a certain way. 
      But expectation breeds tension, while appreciation opens the heart. 
      When you shift from demanding to noticing, from wanting to thanking, life begins to soften. 
      Gratitude turns ordinary days into blessings, and every small moment becomes proof that the universe has already given you more than enough.
